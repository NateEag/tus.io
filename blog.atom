Resumable here means that an interrupted upload can carry on without re-uploading already uploaded data again. An interruption may happen willingly, if the user wants to pause while switching to another workspace, or by accident in case of a network issue or server outage. When resumability is implemented with automatic retries, the user does not need to notice there was an interruption. Since HTTP/1.1 such a resumability is available for file downloads already but not for file uploads as tus offers.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/">tus-js-client</a> is the official client implementation for <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">the tus protocol</a> in JavaScript. It not only supports  <strong>web browsers</strong>, but can also be used in <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>React Native</strong>, and <strong>Apache Cordova</strong> applications.</p>

<p>This release addresses a few cases of odd-behavior from tus-js-client to make it more developer-friendly. We also drop support for older environments and add handy feature for handling parallel uploads and file-based streams.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add support for Parallel Uploads for <code>fs.ReadStream</code></strong><br />
In the previous <a href="https://tus.io/blog/2020/05/04/tus-js-client-200.html">major release of tus-js-client v2.0.0</a> we announced that it now supports parallel upload requests using the <a href="https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#concatenation">Concatenation extension</a>. When enabled, an input file will be split into multiple equally sized parts which are uploaded in parallel. After all requests are finished, the parts will be stitched together on the server-side to produce the original file. The motivation behind this feature is to allow better utilization of network connections and available bandwidth. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v3.0.0/docs/api.md#paralleluploads"><code>parallelUploads</code> documentation</a> for more details.
In this release, support for parallel uploads has been extended to also cover <code>fs.ReadStream</code> as an input type. You can use it like so:
    <pre><code class="language-js">const path = 'my/file.txt'
const file = fs.createReadStream(path)

const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: 'https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/',
  parallelUploads: 3,
})
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Add <code>parallelUploadBoundaries</code> option</strong><br />
If parallel uploads are enabled, this setting can be used to have parts of different size distributions or parts with specific boundaries to satisfy server requirements. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v3.0.0/docs/api.md#paralleluploadboundaries"><code>parallelUploadBoundaries</code> documentation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatically obtain file size for <code>fs.ReadStream</code></strong><br />
tus-js-client has supported uploading an instance of <code>fs.ReadStream</code> directly for a long time. However, you always had to manually specify the file size, like this:
    <pre><code class="language-js">const path = 'my/file.txt'
const file = fs.createReadStream(path)
const { size } = fs.statSync(path)

const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: 'https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/',
  uploadSize: size,
})
</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>uploadSize</code> option is now optional and can be left out:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const path = 'my/file.txt'
const file = fs.createReadStream(path)

const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: 'https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/',
})
</code></pre>
    <p>tus-js-client will automatically obtain the file size from disk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fix resuming of streams in Node.js</strong><br />
Previously, if you wanted to upload a non-file-based stream using tus-js-client and paused the upload using <code>abort()</code>, the resumption using <code>start()</code> could cause a hanging upload. <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/275">This issue</a> has been resolved and resuming properly works now.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix fingerprint removal after successful upload</strong><br />
If the <code>removeFingerprintOnSuccess</code> option was used together with <code>uploadDataDuringCreation</code>, the fingerprint was not always properly removed from the URL storage. <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/397">This issue</a> has been fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>

<p>The main behavior of tus-js-client and the vast majority of its API surface stay the same. However, the following breaking changes were necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drop support for Node.js v12 and earlier</strong><br />
Only Node.js v14 or newer are fully supported and tested for compatibility with tus-js-client from now own. Earlier versions may work, but we don't guarantee or support it.</li>
  <li><strong>Drop support for Internet Explorer</strong><br />
Many dependencies have dropped support for Internet Explorer, and so do we now. tus-js-client will not be compatible with any version of Internet Explorer from now on. Please note that we still support all other browsers as before.</li>
  <li><strong>Rename the exported <code>HttpStack</code> class to <code>DefaultHttpStack</code></strong><br />
tus-js-client allows you to provide a custom HTTP stack using which requests are sent out. If not configured, tus-js-client will use a default implementation depending on the environment. Previously, this class was exported under the <code>HttpStack</code> name. This class shared the name with the <code>HttpStack</code> interface and <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/241">caused a collision</a> when using our TypeScript definitions. As such, we have renamed the <code>HttpStack</code> class (not the interface) to <code>DefaultHttpStack</code>. Please update your references if you are using this class.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not close streams for <code>abort()</code> calls</strong><br />
Previously, if you provided a <code>Reader</code> or <code>Readable</code> stream to tus-js-client and called the <code>abort()</code> method, tus-js-client would stop the upload and close the stream. This is problematic because the upload cannot be resumed later because one cannot read from the stream anymore. From now on, tus-js-client will not close the stream anymore to allow later resuming using <code>start()</code> again. If you do not want to continue the upload, you must close the stream now on your own.
Please note that tus-js-client still closes the stream if the upload was completed successfully (i.e. <code>onSuccess</code> has been invoked), as it has done in previous releases.</li>
  <li><strong>Store upload URL provided by <code>uploadUrl</code></strong><br />
If you create a new upload, its upload URL will be stored in the URL storage by tus-js-client, so it can later be retrieved using <code>tus.Upload#findPreviousUploads()</code> for resuming the uploads. This behavior is controlled by the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v3.0.0/docs/api.md#storefingerprintforresuming"><code>storeFingerprintForResuming</code> option</a>. However, not all servers allow clients to create uploads on their own. Sometimes, the server will supply the client with a pre-defined upload URL to use with the <code>uploadUrl</code> option (e.g. the Vimeo API). Previously, these upload URLs were not stored in the URL storage and could therefore not be retrieved for later resumption.
This release changes this behavior, so that these URLs are also stored by default, and you can use <code>tus.Upload#findPreviousUploads()</code> to retrieve them.
If you do not want to store the upload URL, you can revert to the old behavior by disabling it:
    <pre><code class="language-js">const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  uploadUrl: 'https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/...',
  storeFingerprintForResuming: false,
})
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-it">Try it</h2>

<p>If you'd like to try it out, we have updated our <a href="/demo.html">demo</a> to use tus-js-client v3.0.0 as well. The code for it can be found <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus.io/blob/master/assets/javascripts/upload-demo.js">here</a>. Do leave a comment there how it went!</p>

<p>Finally, we want to thank everyone who helped to make this release happen! If you also want to contribute, you can find our open source code at <a href="https://github.com/tus">GitHub</a>.

This ensures that upgrading the uploading infrastructure from tus 1.0 to 2.0 is as seamless as possible for the end-users as well as for the developers. The most important changes will happen to the structure of the protocol:</p>

<p>The <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">specification of tus 1.0</a> consists of the core uploading protocol and multiple optional extensions, such as the creation extension, termination extension, and checksum extension.

<p>Looking to the future, we'd like to further encourage native implementations of the uploading protocol in browsers and mobile platform SDKs, as well making resumable uploads accessible to more people. To that end, we would like <strong>tus 2.0</strong>, to be an open standard. In considering how to approach standardization, we believe that turning the core uploading protocol into a clear and concise standard within the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> is most appropriate.

Just like all tus servers, tusd's role is to accept incoming uploads from the tus clients and then relay them to the underlying storage providers. For a long time has tusd already supported storing uploads locally on disk, on AWS S3 and Google's Cloud Storage. Thanks to an incredible contribution from <a href="https://github.com/omBratteng">Ole-Martin Bratteng</a>, this support has been expanded to also cover the Azure Cloud Storage!</p>

<h2 id="on-the-backend">On the backend</h2>

<p>The Azure Blob Storage implementation is only supporting the Block Blob. This was a concious choice to make the implementation easier to use, and is the most fitting blob type for tusd. The current service version supported is <code>2019-12-12</code>, which allows files up to 190.7 TiB in size (4000 MiB x 50,000 blocks).</p>

<p>Upon starting tusd with Azure Blob Storage as the selected storage endpoint, it will atempt to connect to a container (also known as a Bucket in S3). If one does not exist, it will be created. You can also specify the access type of the container, which defaults to private, and the default blob access tier type which defaults to the inferred tier from the storage account.</p>

<p>When tusd receives a chunk of data from the client, it will stage the chunk as a block in the Azure Blob Storage. When the client sends the last chunk of data, tusd will then send commit the block list to the Azure Blob Storage, which in part, creates the file in the Azure Blob Storage.</p>

<p>We've also implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/Azure/Azurite">Azurite</a>, which is a lightweight, self-hosted Azure Blob Storage emulator, this can be enabled by using the <code>-azure-endpoint</code> flag. This should also work for custom Azure Blob Storage endpoints, although it has not been tested fully.</p>

When the client sends the last chunk of data, tusd will then send commit the block list to the Azure Blob Storage, which in part, creates the file in the Azure Blob Storage. We've also implemented support for Azurite, which is a lightweight, self-hosted Azure Blob Storage emulator, this can be enabled by using the -azure-endpoint flag. This should also work for custom Azure Blob Storage endpoints, although it has not been tested fully. Give it a try Support for Azure Cloud Storage is part of the v1.7.1 release, where the prebuilt binaries can be downloaded. Give this new feature a try and let us know on GitHub if you encounter any problems! To conclude this blog post, let's again thank Ole-Martin Bratteng for this amazing contribution!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Announcing the tus Advisory Group</title><link href="https://tus.io/blog/2020/11/12/tus-advisory-group.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Announcing the tus Advisory Group" /><published>2020-11-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-11-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://tus.io/blog/2020/11/12/tus-advisory-group</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tus.io/blog/2020/11/12/tus-advisory-group.html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the tus project began in 2013, countless contributors with various technical backgrounds have joined our mission and helped move the protocol forward.

Resumable here means that an interrupted upload can carry on without re-uploading already uploaded data again. An interruption may happen willingly, if the user wants to pause while switching to another workspace, or by accident in case of an network issue or server outage. When resumability is implemented with automatic retries (with this release now the default), the user does not need to notice there was an interruption. Since HTTP/1.1 such a resumability is available for file downloads already but not for file uploads as tus offers.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/">tus-js-client</a> is the official client implementation for <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">the tus protocol</a> in JavaScript. Since it had been born five years ago, it has grown enormously in numbers of features and supported environments. While it was originally designed for <strong>web browsers</strong>, it can now also be used in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Node.js</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>React Native</strong>, and</li>
  <li><strong>Apache Cordova</strong> applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, over time this growth came at the cost of some technical debt which can hinder further development. In this release we cleaned up the code base, removed some odd API decisions from early stages and add long awaited features, such as <strong>Automatic Retries</strong> and <strong>Parallel Chunked Uploads</strong>. We are pleased to introduce you to the all new <strong>tus-js-client v2.0.0</strong>, which packs all this, and more.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>

<p>Besides cleaning up old technical debt, this release also introduces new functionality:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add support for Parallel Uploads</strong><br />
tus-js-client now supports parallel upload requests using the <a href="https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html#concatenation">Concatenation extension</a>. When enabled, an input file will be split into multiple equally sized parts which are uploaded in parallel. After all requests are finished, the parts will be stitched together on the server-side to produce the original file. The motivation behind this feature is to allow better utilization of network connections and available bandwidth. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#paralleluploads"><code>parallelUploads</code> documentation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Upload Storage API</strong><br />
tus-js-client was always able to resume uploads which have been started in a previous browsing session. This is possible by storing the upload resource's URL after it has been created and retrieving it from said storage based on file metadata later on. This allows users to pick up an upload where it had been left off even after the browser is (accidentally) closed. tus-js-client uses the Web Storage API to save this pointer inside the browsers but historically provided little access to retrieve or modify elements in this URL storage.
To remove this limitation, we introduce the URL Storage interface: You are now able to supply your own URL storage using the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#urlstorage"><code>urlStorage</code> option</a>, if you want to save URLs in a database, for example.
Furthermore, you can now easily query the URL storage to retrieve a list of previously started uploads using the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#tusuploadfindpreviousuploads"><code>findPreviousUploads</code> method</a> and ask the end user which upload should be resumed. Please have a look at <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/usage.md#example-let-user-select-upload-to-resume">the corresponding example</a> for more details on this approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Add HTTP abstraction layer</strong><br />
tus-js-client has always contained an abstraction layer to smooth out the differences between the network APIs in browsers and inside Node.js. Users now also have the ability to supply a custom HTTP stack to further customize the used HTTP interface. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#httpstack"><code>httpStack</code> documentation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Add File Reader abstraction layer</strong><br />
Similar to the HTTP abstraction layer, tus-js-client also uses an abstraction to uniformly read data from the different input file types. If you want to add support for another input type, you can supply your own file reader implementation now. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#filereader"><code>fileReader</code> documentation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Add request IDs</strong><br />
tus-js-client can now be configured to send unique request IDs using the <code>X-Request-ID</code> header. Since tus-js-client includes this ID in its error messages, it can be used to correlate client errors with server logs to make debugging easier. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#addrequestid"><code>addRequestId</code> documentation</a> for more details.</li>
  <li><strong>Add request and response callbacks</strong><br />
This release also adds the <code>onBeforeRequest</code> and <code>onAfterResponse</code> callbacks which will be invoked before a HTTP request is sent and directly after a HTTP response is received. This allows you to modify outgoing requests or retrieve additional information from incoming responses. See the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/v2.0.0/docs/api.md#onbeforerequest">documentation</a> for more information and examples.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h2>

<p>The main behavior of tus-js-client and the vast majority of its API surface stay the same. However, the following breaking changes were necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drop support for Node.js 6 and 7</strong><br />
Only Node.js 8 or newer are fully supported and tested for compatibility with tus-js-client from now own. Earlier versions may work but we don't guarantee or support it. Please note that we still support the same browsers as before, with the exception of requiring a polyfill in some cases, explained further down.</li>
  <li><strong>Require support for Promises</strong><br />
The internal code has been partially rewritten to use Promises instead of callbacks, which allowed us to clean up a lot of old spaghetti code. For library users this means that you need to use a <em>Promise polyfill</em> if your application runs in older browsers which do not support Promises. Have a look at <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=promises">caniuse.com</a> for a list of those browsers and <a href="https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-promise">core-js</a> for a polyfill.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Promises for <code>abort</code>/<code>terminate</code> functions</strong><br />
The <code>Upload#abort</code> and <code>Upload.terminate</code> functions do not longer accept a callback but instead return a Promise now. We recommend adding a catch phrase to avoid errors about unhandled rejections. If you have code such as:
    <pre><code class="language-js">upload.abort(true, (err) =&gt; {
  if (err) // Handle error
  else // Handle successful abort call
})
</code></pre>
    <p>you should rewrite it to:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">upload.abort(true).then(() =&gt; {
  // Handle success
}).catch((err) =&gt; {
  // Handle error
})
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use Promises for the <code>fingerprint</code> option</strong><br />
The function that is passed as the <code>fingerprint</code> option into the <code>Upload</code>-constructor is not callback-based anymore. Instead it must also return a Promise. If you supply a custom fingerprint function it must have a signature such as:
    <pre><code class="language-js">function fingerprint (file, options) {
  const result = ....
  return Promise.resolve(result)
})
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enable retries by default</strong><br />
tus-js-client has supported automated retries of network-caused error for years using the <code>retryDelays</code> option. However, in order to avoid breaking changes, this feature had been disabled by default when it was introduced. With this release, the retrying mechanism will be enabled by default to make it easier for new users to take advantage of it. If you have custom retrying code implemented, you may want to check that it is compatible when tus-js-client also retries HTTP requests.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove <code>resume</code> option</strong><br />
Historically, the <code>resume</code> option has controlled whether tus-js-client will check if it is possible to resume an upload from a previous browsing session (e.g. when the browser has accidentally been closed while the upload was still running). This was implemented by calculating the fingerprint for the given input file and comparing it to a list of previously created uploads which was stored in the browser's <code>localStorage</code>. If such an upload exists, tus-js-client would attempt to resume it.
However, this effectively gives the application no control over which upload is resumed. In previous versions, applications were not able to retrieve the list of previously created uploads or remove items from this list. Furthermore, if multiple matching uploads were found for a fingerprint, the applications could not decide which of those uploads should be resumed.
In this release, the <code>resume</code> option has been removed and instead the Upload Storage API has been added. An introduction into the Upload Storage API can be found in the New Features section higher up. If you previously did not explicitly set <code>resume: false</code>, and hence relied on tus-js-client deciding to resume, you can get the previous behavior using following code snippet:
    <pre><code class="language-js">upload = new tus.Upload(file, options)
upload.findPreviousUploads().then((previousUploads) =&gt; {
  if (previousUploads.length &gt; 0) {
    upload.resumeFromPreviousUpload(previousUploads[0])
  }

  upload.start()
})
</code></pre>
    <p>or in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async/await</a> syntax:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">upload = new tus.Upload(file, options)
const previousUploads = await upload.findPreviousUploads()
if (previousUploads.length &gt; 0) {
  upload.resumeFromPreviousUpload(previousUploads[0])
}
upload.start()
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Remove <code>withCredentials</code> option</strong><br />
This release introduces an HTTP abstraction layer to overcome differences between network APIs in browsers and inside Node.js. This makes internal code a lot cleaner but also means that the browser-only <code>withCredentials</code> option is not properly possible anymore. If you used this feature before, you can now explicitly set this flag using the request callbacks:
    <pre><code class="language-js">upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: '....',
  onBeforeRequest: (req) =&gt; {
    const xhr = req.getUnderlyingObject()
    xhr.withCredentials = true
  },
  ....
})
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

Usually, we don't write a blog post about a specific release, but this one is very special to us for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Version 1.6.0 contains three very exiting new features, and</li>
  <li>All of the three features were contributed by members of our community.</li>
</ol>

<p>To raise awareness about those new additions, as well as to thank the contributors for their help, I decided to write a short blog post about them. <!--more--> So, without further ado, let's jump straight in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/paulrosenzweig">Paul Rosenzweig</a> added support for <strong>uploading streaming data</strong> inside your <strong>browser</strong> to a tus server. In the beginning, tus-js-client was only capable of uploading complete files with a pre-known size. However, in some cases you want to upload your data simultaneously while it is arriving from some other services. For example, it's nice to pipe a live-recorded video to your server in real-time. Some time ago, we added support for streaming uploads to tus-js-client inside Node.js, but Paul extended this support to cover browser environments using the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API">JavaScript Streams API</a>. For more details, you might want to look at the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/tree/v1.6.0#new-tusuploadfile-options">documentation</a> or its <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/126">pull request</a>.</li>
  <li>Next up is <a href="https://github.com/arturi">Artur Paikin</a> who contributed a simpler <strong>integration with React Native</strong>. It was already possible to use tus-js-client with React Native, but it required some boilerplate code. Basically, you had to resolve React Native's file URIs before you were able to upload the corresponding files. For his work on <a href="https://uppy.io/">Uppy</a> (an open source, modular and modern file uploader from the folks at <a href="https://transloadit.com">Transloadit</a>) he integrated this boilerplate into tus-js-client, so you can now pass the file URIs directly to tus-js-client without worrying about the details. You can find more details in the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/tree/v1.6.0#react-native-support">documentation</a> or in its <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/132">pull request</a>.</li>
  <li>Last but not least, <a href="https://github.com/hannuniemela">Hannu Niemelä</a> picked up some earlier work from <a href="https://github.com/naranjamecanica">Martijn Swart</a> and blew off some dust. Thanks to their help, you can now use tus-js-client inside your <strong>Apache Cordova application</strong>. That's the fourth platform tus-js-client supports, next to browsers, Node.js and React Native! If you're not aware, <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> allows you to create mobile, cross-platform apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even though it's similar to a browser environment, Cordova's runtime has a few differences that tus-js-client can now easily handle. More details can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/tree/v1.6.0#new-tusuploadfile-options">documentation</a> or in its <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/134">pull request</a>.</li>

A while ago, we noticed something really interesting on tus.io, our open protocol for resumable uploads: a <a href="/implementations.html#comment-2903776646">comment</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/Orajo">Jaroslaw Wasilewski</a> mentioned that tus was being used to support firefighting rescue operations. Now that is exciting news!</p>

<p>While we did set out to make the world a slightly better place by making uploading more reliable for everyone, this is certainly not what we had in mind. We were very interested to learn more about this, so we invited Jaroslaw to sit down with us for a virtual cup of coffee and asked him to tell us a little more about the system they have developed – and how they are using tus for it.</p>

<div class="kodak-container kodak-dropshadow">
<img src="/assets/img/fireman.jpg" alt="Firefighters" style="width: 100%;" />
</div>

<p><strong>Could you tell us something about the work you do and the kind of service your company provides to fire fighters?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainly! My name is Jaroslaw Wasilewski and I work as a developer for an IT company called <a href="http://Bit-sa.pl">BIT S.A.</a>, which is located in Bialystok, Poland. We primarily write dedicated software for government and local administration. Our fire brigades were already using a system for handling requests and directing them to the appropriate, nearest units. There was, however, nothing in place that could support communication during rescue operations, either between units or between the command center and the firefighters in the field, beyond the typical radio communication. So, we developed a set of mobile and web-based applications that allows for messages, documents, data mapping, pictures and videos from the area of action to be sent to the command post and vice versa. It also makes it possible to closely monitor both the location and status of vehicles and firefighters, and it can be used to report the state of the victims. Lastly, it even provides logistic services for long-term rescue operations, such as forest fires or other natural disasters.  The system is currently being tested by firefighters in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podlaskie_Voivodeship">province of Podlasie</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How exactly are you using tus? Could you tell me something about the way it is used in firefighting operations?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tus is being used to send photos, videos and  other documents from mobile application to the back-end as attachments to the exchanged messages. This allows units in the field to immediately give the command center of any rescue operation a full and clear picture of the situation at hand. Fast and reliable file uploading is something that might help to save lives in such cases and, with the help of tus, our system can provide that. A more reliable means of transferring information, even under very poor networking circumstances, means that those in charge of rescue operations are better equipped to make decisions at times when lives are at stake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How did you find out about tus and what led you to implement the protocol in your system?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We needed an effective solution for transferring large types of data, such as high-resolution photos and long videos. Our system was intended to operate on a GSM network, often outside the cities, in areas where coverage tends to be weak and intermittent. With that in mind, the solution should be able to upload files piece by piece and save the current upload state. We didn't want to use FTP because it would be quite difficult to integrate with the REST API and also because partial transfer can be very unreliable. Our <a href="https://netbulls.io/">subcontractor</a>, who develops the mobile parts of the system, told us about tus.  While they themselves had not used it before, it quickly appeared after some more searching for possible solutions and various tests that tus met all of our expectations. The availability of libraries for the Android and .NET platforms was also crucially important for us. Furthermore, thanks to the tusd server and JavaScript client we had a great reference solution for the analysis of the protocol. As a result, we were able to prepare a new implementation of the tus server for PHP, and in parallel, work on the mobile application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Did you encounter any challenges in implementing tus? If so, how did you overcome them?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At that time, the biggest problem was the lack of documentation for version 1.0 of tus. The only available documentation concerned, from what I remember, version 0.2. Therefore, much of our work had to be based on tests and analysis of HTTP messages from the <a href="/demo.html">demo version</a>. That said, thanks to the availability of the tusd server, our subcontractor managed to complete all of their preparations before I'd finished my work. That was a great help. And when the <a href="/protocols/resumable-upload.html">tus protocol 1.0</a> was released, I was able to fix some remaining issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What benefits have the fire departments you work with experienced after tus was implemented?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After several months of intensive testing of the system, we can say that the transfer of files has been very reliable - not a single damaged file has been reported! For that part, we owe a big thanks to tus. As a result, the fire departments that are currently testing this system have had a much more robust and reliable system of communication to their disposal – and something like that can certainly save lives in emergency situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks a lot to Jaroslaw for taking the time to answer our questions about this fascinating use case for tus! Our primary motivation behind the development of tus has been a desire to change the way the world does file uploading. So, with that in mind, you can imagine our excitement when we learned that the protocol was already being trusted with the communications of emergency services. To us, this really stands as a testament to its reliability.</p>

<p>We hope that by sharing this story, more companies and developers might be tempted to give tus a try. After all, the more people that start using this protocol, the sooner truly reliable, resumable uploads can become a reality for all of us. If you’d like to know more about this specific use for tus, or about the protocol in general, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/tus_io">reach out</a>! And if you are also using tus for something interesting, we’d love to hear about that as well!</p>]]></content><author><name>A.J. van Loon</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, oddly enough, this seems to be the case!

Since the introduction of flexible storage back-ends for the official <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd">tusd</a> server, an integration with S3 has been a much desired feature by our users. We are happy to announce that we are now able to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tus/tusd@v1.6.0/pkg/s3store">deliver</a> on this request. During the time it took to create this, we had to deal with various peculiarities of Amazon's service and were able to gain a lot of experience. In this post, we want to focus on the downsides of building a tus server on top of S3 and share some of our recently acquired knowledge with you.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="immutable-objects">Immutable Objects</h2>

<p>We, as the designers of tus, have to admit that the protocol uses a data model which is mostly incompatible with AWS S3. In order to understand this sentence, we need to make a small comparison: In tus, when you want to move a file to a remote location, you first create a new upload resource without pushing any of the file's data to the server. It is even possible to make this operation before you know the length or size of the entire object that you want to transfer. After this step, you are free to upload the data in chunks of any size. The first chunk could be a few MBs, followed by one that is just 100 bytes and a final upload then contains the remaining GB. While this freedom introduces the need for a flexible server implementation, which is capable of handling chunks of any size, it also lays the foundation for tus' core feature: <strong>resumability of an upload at any given time</strong>.</p>

<p>S3, however, does not offer this flexibility: once an object - the length of which must also be known beforehand – has been uploaded to a specific location, you are unable to modify its content without transmitting the entire new file. It is simply not possible to add a chunk to an existing object without having to perform additional operations. It may sound, then, as if the main requirement of the tus protocol is not met by Amazon's service, but that is not the case. You are certainly able to build a proper server implementation for tus, as long as you are willing to accept certain restrictions. This can, for instance, be seen in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/tus/tusd/pkg/s3store">S3 storage back-end</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd">tusd</a> server.</p>

<h2 id="multipart-uploads">Multipart Uploads</h2>

<p>Amazon has been aware of this limitation and therefore supports an alternative approach called <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html">Multipart Uploads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach is very similar to tus' data model described above and it provides a solid foundation to build an implementation upon. However, development would not be called development if it were as easy as mapping a tus upload one-to-one to a multipart upload. The issue is that Amazon sets <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html">certain restrictions</a>, the most notable of which is that the minimum size of a single part is limited to 5MB. The only exception to this rule is the last part, which can be smaller. It should be mentioned here that S3 will not complain when you upload a part that is smaller than 5MB, but only when you attempt to finish the multipart upload that does the actual assembly (it will then present you with the <code>EntityTooSmall</code> error message).</p>

<p>The solution - if you want to call it one - is to only upload parts to S3 that match or exceed the minimum size. The storage back-end for tusd achieves this by writing the body of an incoming <code>PATCH</code> request to a temporary file. Once the upload from the user to our tus server reaches a size of 5MB, we are sure that we have enough data for a single part on S3 and can start moving this chunk to Amazon's service. If the tus server does not receive enough data - ensuring, of course, that it is not the last part, which is allowed to be smaller - it will simply drop the temporarily stored file and require the user to attempt a resume, in the hope that the connection is then more reliable. A look at the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd/blob/bbf706622c7c5234844fbf2b8c5efdbcda1e3861/s3store/s3store.go#L209-L229">code</a> that powers the implementation described above, may help to understand this.</p>

<p>Regrettably, this approach comes with one noticeable downside for the end user: if an upload or resume is interrupted before at least 5MB has reached the tus server, the sent data will be lost and must be retransmitted. Some may ask why we don't simply locally store the received chunk of data on the tus server, wait for the user to resume the upload and then, once we have enough data, push it to S3. This is certainly a good question, but that solution only works when you can ensure that the resumed request reaches the same tus server as the previously interrupted request. If you are running more than a single tus instance, a special routing mechanism may be required to achieve this. Another option would be to use a second storage medium, such as a shared volume, but that would also need to handle concurrent access correctly.</p>

<p>If this workaround is not acceptable for your application because you do not want to limit the chunks to 5MB, you may want to reconsider using AWS S3 as a storage back-end, since it simply does not offer the required functionality. However, if you are using an alternative back-end that just exposes an S3-compatible API, it may offer a configuration option to change the minimum size of a single part. Riak CS (Cloud Storage), for example, accepts the <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/blob/c0c1012d1c9c691c74c8c5d9f69d388f5047bcd2/src/riak_cs_config.erl#L191-L193"><code>enforce_multipart_part_size</code> flag</a>, which can entirely remove this constraint.</p>

<h2 id="s3s-eventual-consistency-model">S3's eventual consistency model</h2>

<p>Amazon's engineers wanted to provide a highly available service and were therefore unable to offer guaranteed consistency for every operation. They nevertheless do not hide this important property of S3 and instead describe it extensively in their <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel">documentation</a>. The most interesting sentence for us, the implementers of tus servers, is the following one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon S3 does not currently support object locking. If two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest time stamp wins. If this is an issue, you will need to build an object-locking mechanism into your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Locking uploads is an important mechanism to prevent data corruption and tus is not immune to it. Imagine a situation where two clients attempt to resume the same upload at the same offset. If the server simply accepts both requests, the latter one may override the data from the first request, resulting in file corruption or loss. In order to prevent this issue, the server needs to acquire an exclusive lock, e.g. a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29">semaphore</a>, on the upload resource before it starts transferring the data and then only release that lock once the data is saved. In this scenario, the server will reject the second request from the client, because a lock cannot be obtained when one is already held.</p>

<p>Implementing a proper locking mechanism is, however, difficult and gets even more complicated if you are working in an environment with multiple distributed servers. In this case, a service should be used that manages distributed locks while at the same time guaranteeing consistency. For example, proven technologies include <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#sc_recipes_Locks">ZooKeeper</a> or <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/lock.html">Consul</a>, but not AWS S3 as it does not offer absolute consistency. Since they do promise "read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in your S3 bucket [but only] eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES", this cannot be used to build a distributed lock upon. Therefore, you are recommended to use a third-party system for doing so.</p>

<p>Another option for preventing concurrent uploading is to put the responsibility on the client's side by saying it is their task to prevent multiple accesses to the same upload resource. While this may work, this approach is not able to guarantee corruption-free uploads since a client still might send two or even more requests at the same time by accident and the server does not prevent that.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-thoughts">Finishing Thoughts</h2>

<p>With S3, engineers have an incredibly useful tool for storing data with high availability and scalability. However, it does not present the perfect storage back-end for the tus protocol and requires some workarounds. In the future, we will have a look at other storage system and cloud providers.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marius Kleidl</name><email>marius@transloadit.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With their Simple Storage System (S3), Amazon Web Services has built one of the major providers of cloud storage for applications ranging from small side projects to enterprise systems.
