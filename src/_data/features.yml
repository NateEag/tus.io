- title: Minimalistic design...
  content: |
    The specification only requires a very small set of features to be
    implemented by clients and servers. tus embraces simplicity, fast
    development and iteration speed for everyone.
- title: ... yet still extensible
  content: |
    tus nevertheless features a sizable list of extensions that introduce additional
    functionality, such as parallel uploading or checksums and expiration. All of these may be
    implemented according to your preferences.

  content: |
    We believe in an open and accessible evolution of this protocol. At any
    stage since the beginning of tus, feedback has been appreciated and
    integrated. We look forward to your contributions as well.
